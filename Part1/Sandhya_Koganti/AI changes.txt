Recipe:1
1.I have added the output node "cream" for the first input node at line "32" as the container for that
  label has been changed.
2.Deleted the nodes from 66-172(given json file). as they are repetitive and not as per the text given. We don'tneed them.
3.Changed the input node at line 173 as the label 'bottle' is not necessary . The label that is spposed to present is the glass.
  The output node of the previous node. And changed the ingredient name to 'liquid ectract'
4.added the input node spoon at line 231(modified file) as we are using it for stirring.
5.I have changed the input and motion node nad output node of the last node(given json file) as per the text file given.
   i.e motion_node to mix. Output node label to "mixture", container to "glass"


Recipe 2:
1.In the modified json file I ahve added a new input node at line 12 for "water" as in the text file it is given that the peach is washed.
  and added the respective motion node and the output node.
2.I have taken the output of the first node as the input for the next one. For the output of the second node at line 57 I have added a new
   state "washed".
3.In the given json file they haven't added a node for cutting the banana. So at Line 114 I have added a new node for banana cutting.
4.After this I have added a two new nodes for adding peach and banana to the blender and for washing the spinach from Line 133-206.
5.At Line 222 I have added spinach to the blender and then added the state "washed" for spinach.
6.At Line 282 in the modified file I have changed the container to "blender" which was "null" in the given original json file.
7.At Line 351 I have added "water" as output node within container "blender"
8.I have removed lines 239-278 from the original json file as they are repetetive and not required. Same as the above nodes.

Recipe 3:
1.From the original json file given, I have removed label "glass" at Line 117, as it is not required. We are not making use of glass at that step.
2.For line 129 of original json, I have changed the label to "spinachblender"
3.The same for line 175.
4.I have removed the lines from 193-201 and 212-225 and from 248-263 as they have already been added to the blender.
  As per the given the text file. It is not required to add those nodes.
5.Removed leaf state from line 280. As spinach is already blended so it has state "liquid".
6.Added the output node "flaxseeds" at line 243 in the modified json file.
7.Removed the lines 517-532 and from 553-568 as those ingredients are already added to the blender and blended.
8.At last the mixture is poured into the glass. So changes the container to "glass"
